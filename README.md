FLAPPY BIRD

Created and implemented a flappy bird game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specifically, using html5 canvas. 

Learnt how to create the game loop, add images onto the canvas, add click handlers to make the flappy bird jump, randomly generate pipes and move them across the screen, detect collisions between the flappy bird and each pipe, and add a running score.

TO RUN : 
1. Download the zip file from GITHUB.
2. Run the "index.html" file and it will open the game on the website.

HAPPY PLAYING!!
